          <h2>How it Works</h2>
          <p>Our platform provides comprehensive information about each NGO, including their mission, history, and impact, to help philanthropists make informed decisions. Philanthropists can search for NGOs based on their areas of interest, and receive real-time updates on the use of their funds and the impact of their donations. NGOs can reach a larger audience and secure the funding they need to carry out their missions.</p>
